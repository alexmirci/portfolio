            <p class="descriere">I'm a 21 year old Computer Science stundent, currently expanding my web development skills. I finished highschool at 
                "Nicolae Balcescu", in Cluj-Napoca, the city in which I was also born and raised. I have a strong passion for team sports - especially
                basketball. I was part of U Banca Transilvania for as long as I can remember until I was 18, winning no less than 5 National
                Championships and one individual award. In 2017, I graduated highschool and became a student at the Babes Bolyai University.
                My favourite subject I studied was Web Programming, in which I was interested since before University.
